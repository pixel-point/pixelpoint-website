For the last couple of days in the internet, you probably have seen a lot of news about **event-stream npm package vulnerability** and that package steals bitcoins. I was disappointed that I had to read tons on articles before actually get the answers on the following questions:

- **Does it affect my projects?**
- **What should I do?**

So I decided to put here my today research and a short overview as possible to help you find and fix the problem for your projects.

- existing information tells that targeted package which only affected by the vulnerability of the event-stream package is copay-dash. **If you don’t have copay-dash, relax and continue read calmly;**
- event-stream@3.3.6 had a vulnerability in the dependency package flatmap-stream@0.1.1;
- the vulnerable version of that package already removed from the npm registry;
- removing the package from the npm registry caused the issue that on npm install(fresh install, without cache) and npm audit you will get an error;

```bash
npm ERR! code ENOAUDIT
```

or

```bash
npm ERR! code E404
npm ERR! 404 Not Found: flatmap-stream@0.1.1
```

- if you have that error, your project has vulnerable package;
- a lot of popular packages were affected, for example, nodemon;
- search through your yarn.lock or package-lock.json and find the root package which installs flatmap-stream@0.1.1;
- visit github pages of packages which were affected and maybe there is already new version with a fix. So just install new version with a command like `npm install nodemon@latest -D`;
