  text: Before contracting Pixel Point for our new website, we have already failed 2 times working with other agencies. Lesson learned is to build a website for a DevTool company, the design partner needs to understand developers. Turns out Pixel Point has far exceeded our expectation, they are developers, understand open source and in particular, our database domain, of course, they are top-notch designers. The result, a new website impressed every one of us.

Bytebase offers a web-based collaboration workspace to help DBAs and Developers manage the database development lifecycle. It is built by engineers from top companies like Google and Ant Group and backed up by their expertise in database development flow. In the DevOps methodology, teams adopt GitHub for code management, and Bytebase offers a similar solution but for database management.

Guys came to Pixel Point after previous unsuccessful attempts at redesigning their website, so it was crucial to us to provide not only our design expertise but also demonstrate our knowledge in open source project development and database management. The overall concept was simple: renovate the Bytebase website, make it more dynamic and smooth, while maintaining the existing brand identity. The modern tech stack (React, Rive, TypeScript, Next.js) was used to ensure optimal performance. We focused on popping animations featuring the Bytebase mascot, integrating them not only in the home page hero section, but also in various places through the website. The illustrations focus on explaining the database management flow in a clear way, highlighting the features Bytebase provides for facilitating team work and collaboration.

The new website has left the Bytebase team happy, as it successfully carried on the previous brand identity, developing it into a web piece of art combining clean layouts and playful motion design.
