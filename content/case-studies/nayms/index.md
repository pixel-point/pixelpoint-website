In 2019, individuals called "nayms" came together to create the most efficient capital provision ecosystem for the worlds digital risk. A rather ambitious goal, but within a few years of hard work they were able to build a product ready to be used by the new wave of insurtech pioneers. It was time to expose Nayms to a broad audience, but to conquer the market, you have to look appropriately, and they reached us out for help in the spring of 2021.

We were fascinated by the clever and creative way they came around the problem, but also noted the complexity of area they are dealing with. One simply can’t afford to look boring when speaking to customers of topics of high perplexity such as blockchain is . It was indeed a challenge for us, and we went to the moon and back find that perfect visual direction that will support guys in their venture.

We opted-in for a light fresh look mixed with a moderately bright colour palette, then added some dark-themed sections to weight it down. We bet heavily on 3D visuals, illustrations and animations, making it a next focal point after the content. This approach didn’t come cheap - we had to perform quite a few optimisations rounds to keep the performance score at 100 for desktops. The Nayms team enjoyed the final result, and we hope their growing community will do the same.
