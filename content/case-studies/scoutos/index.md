ScoutOS is a fast-evolving AI platform for building and deploying LLM-powered workflows. With a fully integrated stack from ingestion to benchmarking, ScoutOS helps teams get AI into production faster and with less friction.

They came to us to overhaul their marketing site: a full visual redesign paired with a CMS-powered backend to accelerate their content-heavy growth strategy. The previous site required code-level edits for every update, slowing down iteration at a critical stage.

We reimagined the site for scalability: clean layouts, refined typography, and a cohesive set of reusable components. Dedicated feature illustrations now explain each core product area, from Integrations to Templates, in a way that speaks to both technical and non-technical audiences.

To support long-term growth, we built a flexible CMS for blog posts, documentation, and landing pages. We continue to expand Scout's content library by designing reusable components and templates that let their team move fast while staying consistent.

What began as a redesign has become an ongoing creative partnership. As ScoutOS evolves, we're proud to support their journey, adapting the site to match the pace and ambition of their product.
