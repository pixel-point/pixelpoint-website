Vantage is a leading platform for cloud cost optimization, offering engineering and finance teams deep visibility and control over their cloud spend. As the company scaled and matured, they approached us to refresh their brand and redesign their website with the goal of elevating their identity without straying from the trust they've built among developers and enterprise clients.

Our work began with a careful brand refresh. We preserved the existing logo but introduced a new typographic system, refined the light-themed UI, and expanded the color palette. Purple remained the primary brand color, now paired with polished accents and more structured layouts to enhance clarity and visual consistency.

A major focus of the redesign was content depth and scalability. We redesigned core pages like the homepage, pricing, and blog and also updated a large number of feature and integration pages. Each was rebuilt using a library of custom illustrations and reusable components, ensuring consistency and faster iterations.

Subtle visual effects and animations were used to add engagement without distraction. We also used product screen illustrations to ground the experience in the Vantage interface.

We're proud to have supported Vantage during this key stage of their growth, and to have delivered a digital experience that balances trust, clarity, and technical sophistication.
