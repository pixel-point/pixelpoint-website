Browserless became yet another project in the portfolio of Polychrome Capital, who we’ve been working closely with since the [Flagsmith](/case-studies/flagsmith) project. Of course, they didn't hesitate to reach us out for assistance.

Briefing made it clear that design should express confidence, maturity, and obvious signs of tech origins, while keeping it a bit playful. We did the trick using a variety of bright colors over the black and white base, combined with the huge set of animations. This set consisted of two groups: the focal animations for the most important blocks like hero, and the small decorative ones for icons and section backgrounds to keep the lively look of the pages. By applying our cooking recipes to Framer and Lottie animations libraries, we were able to keep them performant for the majority of devices.

Browserless was built on GatsbyJS + Headless WP, proving worth of this setup yet again, and the experience we gained working with it allowed us to build up custom blog and documentation portals in no time.

When the website went public, it was really warm welcomed by Twitter community and even hit the top #1 of that month on Landbook.
