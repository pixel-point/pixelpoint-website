Huly, an innovative open-source platform, combines the functionalities of Linear, Jira, Slack, and Notion into one comprehensive tool for process, project, time, and knowledge management.

The project commenced after Huly's CEO, impressed by our past projects shared on social media, reached out to discuss timelines and budgets that would meet their highest standards. Our challenge was to design a web presence that was eye-catching and appealing, capable of conveying a complex set of features in a comprehensive manner.

Our approach involved closely collaborating with Huly's team to create a clean, modern website that emphasized the user-friendliness of the extensive feature set, integrating smooth animations to boost user engagement. This agile, iterative process allowed for continuous refinement, aligning the design closely with Huly's product functionality.

The resulting website showcased Huly's promise of streamlined team collaboration, setting a new benchmark in design that supports complex functionalities in a user-friendly manner. Despite the challenges of integrating complex animations into a cohesive layout, the successful launch of the Huly website stands as a testament to our team's expertise in creating a landing page that is both impressive and intuitive for users to navigate.
