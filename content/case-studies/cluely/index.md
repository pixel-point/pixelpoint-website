Cluely is redefining the way professionals access information during live conversations. Their undetectable AI assistant provides real-time answers in meetings, sales calls, and across any application — without ever appearing on screen.

With a product evolving quickly and targeting market disruption, Cluely needed a website that matched its ambition. They turned to us for a top-tier design and build — one that could clearly demonstrate a complex, invisible product and adapt to rapid iteration.

We structured the site around the pillars of the user experience brought to life through top-notch motion design. Scroll-triggered UI animations explain how Cluely handles most common scenarios with minimal friction and maximum clarity. We also extended the visual system to support the Enterprise, Pricing, and Manifesto pages — all while maintaining a strong, minimal aesthetic built on contrast, clarity, and modern typography.

This collaboration resulted in a lightweight, responsive, and future-facing site that communicates Cluely's value in seconds — and supports its ambition to reshape how people interact with AI in live settings.
