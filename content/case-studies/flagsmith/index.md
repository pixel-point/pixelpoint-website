Freshly acquired by Polychrome Capitals, guys were in the process of a major company transformation requiring full rebranding - and we were eager to help.

We began with picking a distinctive color palette and a font that played nicely around the company message, then restructured content representation in a visually pleasing way. Devs chose a time-tested pair of GatsbyJS + Headless WP, which made it possible to create custom marketing pages on a whim with the library of reusable components. It took us just under 2 months to complete the whole platform!

We believe it had played a role in the events that took place shortly after: Flagsmith made it to Product Hunt top 5 and received 2 acquisitions offers.
