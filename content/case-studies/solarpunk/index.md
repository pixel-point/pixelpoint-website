Solarpunk is a platform revolutionizing farming with agrivoltaics — the dual use of land for solar energy and agriculture. Their mission is to simplify solar deployment for farmers, reducing bureaucracy, planning, and financing hurdles. This approach boosts yields (up to 160%), creates microclimates to protect crops, and generates new revenue streams.

Inspired by firsthand experience with the challenges of traditional agriculture, Solarpunk aims to transition farming into a sustainable future. Their platform provides tools for project planning, partner matching, and funding access—all in one user-friendly interface.

Solarpunk partnered with us to design and launch a website that clearly communicates their mission and drives adoption of agrivoltaics. We delivered a clean, modern design enhanced by custom animations that illustrate agrivoltaic benefits like reduced heat stress and dual-use land productivity. Clear calls to action guide landowners to explore and engage with the platform.

The successful launch of Solarpunk positions them as a visionary in sustainable farming innovation. We are proud to support their mission to empower farmers and combat climate change.
