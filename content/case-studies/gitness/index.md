Gitness, by Harness, is an open-source code hosting and CI/CD platform. It features robust security, one-click migration from platforms like GitHub, and delivers 4x faster pipeline execution with versatile templates.

Our journey with Gitness was intense and rewarding. With a tight deadline of just seven weeks to transform an idea into a fully operational website for a conference showcase, every moment counted. The initial four weeks were dedicated to branding and designing both the homepage and the documentation portal. Our efforts culminated in a design that received immediate approval, with no revisions needed. The subsequent three weeks saw us diving deep into creating interactive animations using Rive and developing a high-performance, visually captivating landing page. We were able to complete all the work a couple of days ahead of the deadline, allowing ample time for polishing and making any necessary copy changes.

Pixel Point's recipe for success is a blend of careful planning with effective expectation management, all while benefiting from the client's trust in our expertise. The resulting Gitness website stands as a testament to what modern development platforms should embody: sleek, visually striking, yet minimalistic and highly functional. It targets the forward-thinking developers of tomorrow, equipping them with the tools they need to excel.
