Gitness (a.k.a. Harness Open Source) is an open-source code hosting and CI/CD platform. It features robust security, one-click migration from platforms like GitHub, and delivers 4x faster pipeline execution with versatile templates.

We have been collaborating with the [Harness](/case-studies/harness) team on various projects since 2019 so when they approached us to help launch the new Gitness website, we were excited to take on the challenge of creating a brand identity and website that would effectively communicate the platform's capabilities and appeal to developers.

Our journey with Gitness was intense and rewarding. With a tight deadline of just seven weeks to transform an idea into a fully operational website for a conference showcase, every moment counted. The initial four weeks were dedicated to branding and designing the homepage and the documentation portal. Our efforts culminated in a design that received immediate approval, with no revisions needed. The subsequent three weeks saw us diving deep into creating interactive animations using Rive and developing a high-performance landing page. We were able to complete all the work a couple of days ahead of the deadline, allowing time for polishing and making necessary copy changes.

Pixel Point's recipe for success is a blend of careful planning with effective expectation management, all while benefiting from the client's trust in our expertise. The resulting Gitness website stands as a testament to what modern development platforms should embody: sleek, visually striking, yet minimalistic and highly functional. The new website was met with enthusiasm by the community, attracting more than 500k post views and 3k GitHub stars in just the first week, and we are proud to have played a role in bringing this project to life.
