Parca is the modern, open-source, eBPF-based continuous profiling software, which helps you analyze CPU and memory usage down to the line number and throughout time. The benefits one could get are reduced infrastructure cost, improved performance, and increased reliability.

From the beginning Parca team was embracing creativity, so we pulled out one of our brave design ideas and created a really unique look and feel. We went through a lot of drafts in Adobe After Effect working on animations that can potentiate the story, picked some, and implemented them natively with canvas, the remaining parts, like icons, were animated in Rive. The new website engages users right from the nicely animated hero section, keeps their attention through the bold statements and key selling points, and gracefully ends the journey with a reference to Parcaâ€™s open-source nature and its community.
