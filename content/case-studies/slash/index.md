Slash is a fintech startup focused on providing tailored banking solutions for high-spend verticals like ticket resellers and performance marketers. Their platform offers features like 2% cashback, unlimited virtual cards, and free wires, designed specifically for entrepreneurs who need more than generic banking servicesю

With plans to expand beyond outbound sales and referrals, Slash needed a website that could support broader marketing efforts, inspire trust, and reflect their edge as a high-performance fintech brand. Their initial input called for a hard identity — more Porsche than pastel SaaS.

We delivered a sleek, performance-optimized website built on Next.js and Sanity CMS, emphasizing clarity, trust, and strategic positioning. Strong typography, minimal layouts, and bold minimalistic visuals reinforced Slash's no-nonsense approach. Each section of the site speaks directly to the needs of its niche users, from inventory-matching tools to ad spend optimization.

The new digital presence is more than a facelift — it is a growth platform. It supports Slash's ambitious plans to scale its marketing efforts, launch campaigns, and expand its reach into new verticals. The site is designed to convert visitors into customers, with clear calls to action and a user-friendly experience that guides entrepreneurs through the onboarding process.

This project sets the stage for Slash to lead in fintech for underserved verticals — one high-spend niche at a time. We continue to support them on a retainer basis, creating new pages and ensuring their website evolves alongside their business.
