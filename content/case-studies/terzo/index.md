  text: Alex, Kate, and team at Pixel Point consistently went above and beyond redesigning our new website. Their design work is truly amazing. They did such an excellent job of casting our vision into our new website and helped us find the brand we were seeking. I also appreciated how gritty they were to meet deadlines and get things done. We are looking forward to continuing to build out our website even more with them!

Terzo is a technology startup focused on contract management. Their main product is an AI-driven Contract Intelligence and Supplier Management solution that empowers businesses to automate repetitive tasks and improve operational efficiency. By leveraging their Contract Analytics platform, companies can optimize spend, improve governance, and reduce costs hidden in their contracts.

The Terzo team approached us with a specific goal in mind: they wanted to create an impressive website to highlight the capabilities of their AI-powered contract management platform and position it as a premium product. Our starting point was the home page hero section, where we aimed to demonstrate the platform's functionality through an intuitive and visually appealing animation. To achieve a sophisticated and professional look, we decided to use a predominantly dark color scheme with strategic pops of color. For the blog and content library, we opted for Storyblok, a user-friendly and contemporary headless CMS, to streamline the process of creating and managing posts.

Our collaboration was truly inspiring, and we continue working with Terzo to the present moment, creating new stunning pages and animations to highlight new features as their product evolves.
