Search Party is pioneering AI-native performance marketing and GEO. Built for the post-Google era, the platform helps enterprise brands become discoverable and framed correctly across large language models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Rather than just reporting on visibility, Search Party goes furtherâ€”prescribing exact content, prompts, and agent strategies to boost brand presence inside AI systems.

The Search Party team approached us with the ambition to create a bold brand and website that would set them apart in a crowded and often stale B2B landscape. They wanted to signal trust, precision, and automation, while making the experience engaging, delightful, and accessible to marketers. The goal was to create a brand and interface that felt like an intuitive toolkit for the next generation of performance marketing.

We began with the visual style development, inspired by the dual meaning of the name Search Party, both literal (a new kind of search) and metaphorical (a proactive team helping you get found) and developed a brand system that combined technical precision with organic motion.

Around that time, the creative input from the Search PArty team changed as they sought to make the brand feel more human, intuitive, and "microdosed with delight". We led this stylistic shift, transitioning from a dark, highly technical palette to a creamier light theme with splashes of vibrant color and natural geometric patterns. Inspired by fractals and tessellations, we introduced layered textures and ambient animation to evoke friendly intelligence without overwhelming the user.

Once the brand direction was set, we designed and developed the core website experience. Built with Next.js and a Sanity-based CMS, the site is fully modular, giving the Search Party team complete control over content publishing and iteration. We designed explanatory product illustrations and interactive visuals to guide users through Search Party's value proposition, from AI benchmarking to agent strategy recommendations. The final octopus logo was also created at this stage: intelligent, adaptive, and reaching across networks.

Our collaboration with Search Party is ongoing. As the company continues to trailblaze in the rapidly evolving generative engine optimization space, we're proud to support their creative evolution and digital presence, helping them stay not just visible, but unforgettable.
