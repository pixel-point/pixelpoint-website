Cilium project is an integral part of the rapidly growing [Isovalent](/case-studies/isovalent) company which brings the power of eBPF to Cloud Native environment, improving a lot networking, observability and security.

Since September 2021 we’ve been working side-by-side with their team in the pursuit of a brand new look for all 3 websites they possess - eBPF, Cilium, and Isovalent. We helped them not only improve the design quality of their marketing pages, but also satisfied the buisiness needs for various 3rd party integrations, like Recruitee, Hubspot, Addevent, and Iubenda. We also ensured they have proper tools and a clear workflow for a flexible and comfortable content management.

Guys were really impressed with our working speed and eager communication, so our story with Cilium continues to this day and won’t be over untill their brand image matches the company nature.
