For over a decade, a team of highly experienced software and DevOps engineers has gathered enough evidence that managing configuration files has become tedious, costly, and risky. Having had enough of manual setups, bottlenecks, and production failures, they embarked on a journey to build the ultimate configuration management tool and revolutionize the way software is being developed and maintained. Thus, the Configu company was born.

We met the guys in 2022, when the beta version of their app was ready to conquer the market, and the only missing piece for success was their look in the eyes of the customer. The challenge was to create a brand identity that would convey quality, trustworthiness and innovation of their product. We solved it by developing a minimalistic visual language that is both recognizable and meaningful. A combination of bold shapes, typography, and color palette crowned with a magnificent hero animation helped the project to stand out and created a memorable brand that we believe would make Configu a household name in the DevOps world. Apart from the fully-fledged marketing platform, including docs and blog portals, we also made a design touch to Configuâ€™s web application, aligning it with the new brand style guidelines.

The collaboration between Configu and our agency proved to be a successful one. We are immensely glad to work with such a great company and even more happy to continue our partnership for the good.
