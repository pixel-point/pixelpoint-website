Harness is the AI-augmented software delivery platform designed to be a pioneer in its industry, featuring innovative CI/CD pipelines, advanced security features, and a user-centric interface for enhanced productivity in the software delivery process.

We have been working with the Harness team on various projects since 2019, so they had a lot of trust in our expertise in creating cutting-edge design from the start of this project. Our team focused on crafting an immersive user experience, highlighted by interactive animations and a distinctive visual identity. Continuous collaboration with Harness allowed us to refine the branding and prototypes, resulting in the design that were both visually and functionally aligned with Harness's vision.

However, despite the detailed execution and the client's initial positive feedback, the website was ultimately not launched due to a radical shift in product messaging at Harness, which occurred just as we were adding the finishing touches. This late-stage pivot made it clear that the new strategic direction required a different approach to website design, leading to the decision to shelf the project.

Nevertheless, the Harness project remains a benchmark within our portfolio, demonstrating our commitment to pushing the boundaries of design and user interaction in web development. In the meantime, we continue to work with Harness on product design for their platform.
